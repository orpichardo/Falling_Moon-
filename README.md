##Description
*The Sun God has Calapsed in itself forming a blackhole in space, earth is half way gone. Only the Moon Godess remains. The black hole is pulling the Moon towards it, there is no escape... It's too late. the Moon Godess is gone. Swallowed into the infinite of nothingness inside the blackhole. But wait, what is this? A blackhole inside another blackhole? How is this possible? How many are there? Only one way to find out.*


Falling Moon is a simple game. Beat your score. Its Infinite! It helps with reflexas and focus (I'm not a doctor), where should you move next? left or right? keep going left? or keep going right? Look ahead and see where the next blackhole will be.
